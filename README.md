# 2. Executive Summary (Business Overview)

Agentic System is an AI-powered document assistant designed to help users interpret, analyse, and process documents more efficiently.  
The project demonstrates how modern agentic workflows, built with LangChain and LangGraph, can automate multi-step reasoning tasks and provide structured, guided assistance for real-world document use cases.

In many contexts—especially administrative, academic, and professional workflows—users face complex documents that require time, attention, and repeated manual interpretation. Agentic System addresses this challenge by enabling an AI agent capable of:

- Reading and extracting information from documents  
- Summarising and restructuring content  
- Answering questions based on user inputs and document context  
- Providing step-by-step guidance for administrative tasks  
- Automating information retrieval and transformation  

The application offers a simple and efficient user interface built with Streamlit, making document assistance accessible to any user. The system combines a reasoning-capable agent, custom tools, and a clear agentic workflow to deliver a complete end-to-end experience.
